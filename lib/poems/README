--------------

This is version 1.0 of the POEMS library, general purpose distributed
multibody dynamics software, which is able to simulate the dynamics of
articulated body systems.

This library must be built with a C++ compiler, before LAMMPS is
built, so LAMMPS can link against it.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefiles or creating your
own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.g++

If the build is successful, you should end up with a libpoems.a file.
