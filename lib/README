This directory contains libraries that can be linked with when
building LAMMPS.  The library itself must be built first, so that a
lib*.a file exists for LAMMPS to link against.

Each library directory contains a README with additional info.  You
will need to copy one of the Makefile.* files to Makefile before
building a library.  If a Makefile.* suitable for your machine does
not exist, you will need to edit one of the existing Makefiles.

The libraries included in the LAMMPS distribution are the following:

atc           atomistic-to-continuum methods
                from Reese Jones, Jeremy Templeton, Jon Zimmerman (Sandia)
gpu	      graphical processor (GPU) routines, currently NVIDIA specific,
	        from Mike Brown (Sandia)
poems	      POEMS rigid-body integration package
                from RPI
meam	      modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential
                from Greg Wagner (Sandia)
reax          ReaxFF potential
	        from Adri van Duin (Penn State) and Aidan Thompson (Sandia)
