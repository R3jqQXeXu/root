--------------

This library is in implementation of the MEAM potential, specifically
designed to work with LAMMPS.

This library must be built with a F90 compiler, before LAMMPS is
built, so LAMMPS can link against it.

Build the library using one of the provided Makefiles or creating your
own, specific to your compiler and system.  For example:

make -f Makefile.g95

If the build is successful, you should end up with a libmeam.a file.
