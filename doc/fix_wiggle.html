<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Move a group of atoms in a sinusoidal oscillation.  This is useful in
granular simulations when boundary atoms are wiggled to induce packing
of the dynamic atoms.  The dimension <I>dim</I> of movement is specified as
is the <I>amplitude</I> and <I>period</I> of the oscillations.  Each timestep
the <I>dim</I> coordinate of each atom is set to
</P>
<PRE>coord = coord0 + A - A cos (omega * delta) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>coord0</I> is the coordinate at the time the fix was specified,
<I>A</I> is the <I>amplitude</I>, <I>omega</I> is 2 PI / <I>period</I>, and <I>delta</I> is the
elapsed time since the fix was specified.  The velocity of the atom is
set to the derivative of this expression.
</P>
<P>Note that if a value of A > 0 is specified, each wiggling atom does
not oscillate around its initial position, but moves entirely in the
positive direction relative to its initial position.  This is so that
its initial velocity will be 0.0.

<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
