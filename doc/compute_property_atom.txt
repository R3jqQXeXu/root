compute property/atom command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID property/atom input1 input2 ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
property/atom = style name of this compute command :l
input = one or more atom attributes :l
  possible attributes = id, mol, type, mass,
 	                x, y, z, xs, ys, zs, xu, yu, zu, ix, iy, iz,
		        vx, vy, vz, fx, fy, fz,
                        q, mux, muy, muz,
                        radius, omegax, omegay, omegaz,
                        angmomx, angmomy, angmomz,
		        quatw, quati, quatj, quatk, tqx, tqy, tqz :pre

      id = atom ID
      mol = molecule ID
      type = atom type
      mass = atom mass
      x,y,z = unscaled atom coordinates
      xs,ys,zs = scaled atom coordinates
      xu,yu,zu = unwrapped atom coordinates
      ix,iy,iz = box image that the atom is in
      vx,vy,vz = atom velocities
      fx,fy,fz = forces on atoms
      q = atom charge
      mux,muy,muz = orientation of dipolar atom
      radius = radius of extended spherical particle
      omegax,omegay,omegaz = angular velocity of extended particle
      angmomx,angmomy,angmomz = angular momentum of extended particle
      quatw,quati,quatj,quatk = quaternion components for aspherical particles
      tqx,tqy,tqz = torque on extended particles :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 all property/atom xs vx fx mux 
compute 2 all property/atom type
compute 1 all property/atom ix iy iz :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that simply stores atom attributes for each atom
in the group.  This is useful so that the values can be used by other
"output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15 that take computes as
inputs.  See for example, the "compute reduce"_compute_reduce.html,
"fix ave/atom"_fix_ave_atom.html, "fix ave/histo"_fix_ave_histo.html,
"fix ave/spatial"_fix_ave_spatial.html, and "atom-style
variable"_variable.html commands.

The list of possible attributes is the same as that used by the "dump
custom"_dump.html command, which describes their meaning.  Basically,
this list gives your input script access to any per-atom quantity
stored by LAMMPS.

The values are stored in a per-atom vector or array as
discussed below.  Zeroes are stored for atoms not in the specified
group.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-atom vector or per-atom array depending
on the number of input values.  If a single input is specified, a
per-atom vector is produced.  If two or more inputs are specified, a
per-atom array is produced where the number of columns = the number of
inputs.  The vector or array can be accessed by any command that uses
per-atom values from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#4_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

The vector or array values will be in whatever "units"_units.html the
corresponding attribute is in, e.g. velocity units for vx, charge
units for q, etc.
