<H3>processors command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>processors Px Py Pz 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>Px,Py,Pz = # of processors in each dimension of a 3d grid 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>processors 2 4 4 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Specify how processors are mapped as a 3d logical grid to the global
simulation box.
</P>
<P>When this command has not been specified, LAMMPS will choose Px, Py,
Pz based on the dimensions of the global simulation box so as to
minimize the surface/volume ratio of each processor's sub-domain.
</P>
<P>Since LAMMPS does not load-balance by changing the grid of 3d
processors on-the-fly, this command should be used to override the
LAMMPS default if it is known to be sub-optimal for a particular
problem.  For example, a problem where the atom's extent will change
dramatically over the course of the simulation.
</P>
<P>The product of Px, Py, Pz must equal P, the total # of processors
LAMMPS is running on.  If multiple partitions are being used then P is
the number of processors in this partition; see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> for an explanation of the -partition
command-line switch.
</P>
<P>If P is large and prime, a grid such as 1 x P x 1 will be required,
which may incur extra communication costs.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command cannot be used after the simulation box is defined by a
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
It can be used before a restart file is read to change the 3d
processor grid from what is specified in the restart file.
