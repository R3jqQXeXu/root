</PRE>
<P><B>LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:</B>
</P>
<P>This command has been improved in accordance with the overhauled 
<A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair gran/* styles</A>. Furthermore, it offers the new 
wallstyle mesh/gran, which enables fix wall/gran to handle complex 
wall geometries imported from CAD.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Bound the simulation domain of a granular system with a frictional wall. 
All particles in the group interact with the wall when they are close enough 
to touch it. The equation for the force between the wall and particles 
touching it is the same as the corresponding equation on the 
<A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair_style granular</A> doc page, in the limit of one of the
 two particles going to infinite radius and mass (flat wall).
</P>
<P>You must choose the <I>wallstyle</I> matching the pair style used, otherwise 
an error is created (e.g.: "pair gran/hertz/history is incompatible with 
fix wall/gran/hooke"). As with <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair_style granular</A>, you have 
to define the mechanical properties for each material you are used in the 
simulation with fix property commands. See <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair_style granular</A>
 for more details.
</P>
<P>For <I>wallstyle mesh/gran</I>, the interaction for the tri-sphere interaction 
is mostly based on the following paper: "A method for representing boundaries 
in discrete element modelling" , M. Kremmer, J.F. Favier, Int. Journal for 
Numerical Methods in Engineering (2001), 51(12), 1407. Internally, 
triangle-particle neighbor lists are built to efficiently track particle-triangle 
contacts. Particle-tri neighbor list build is triggered if any particle moves 
more than half the skin distance or (in case of moving mesh) if the mesh 
itself moves more than half the skin distance since the last build. A warning 
is generated if a dangerous particle-tri neigh list build is detected 
(e.g. if particles are inserted too close to a wall, see section 'Restrictions'). 
For style <I>mesh/gran</I>, <I>atom_type_wall</I> is inherited from the atom style provided 
in the <A HREF = "fix_mesh_gran.html">fix mesh/gran</A> command. fix_id1, fix_id2 etc. must 
be IDs of valid fixes of type <A HREF = "fix_mesh_gran.html">fix mesh/gran</A>, defining 
the granular mesh to be used for the wall.
</P>
<P>Other wallstyles can be <I>xplane</I> or <I>yplane</I> or <I>zplane</I> or <I>cylindrical</I> 
or <I>conical</I>. The 3 planar options specify a pair of walls in a dimension. 
Wall positions are given by values for lo and hi. Either of the values 
can be specified as NULL if a single wall is desired. For a <I>zcylinder</I> 
wallstyle, the cylinder's axis is at x = y = 0.0, and the radius of the 
cylinder is specified. Likewise, a <I>zcone</I> wallstyle can be used, with 
the axis at x = y = 0.0, and the hi and lo radii being specified.
</P>
<P>Optionally, planar or cylindrical or conical walls can be moving, if 
the wiggle or shear keywords are appended. Both keywords cannot be used together.
</P>
<P>For the <I>wiggle</I> keyword, the wall oscillates sinusoidally, similar to the 
oscillations of frozen particles specified by the <A HREF = "fix_wiggle.html">fix wiggle</A>
command. This is useful in packing simulations of granular particles. The 
arguments to the <I>wiggle</I> keyword specify a dimension for the motion, as 
well as it's amplitude and period. Note that if the dimension is in the 
plane of the wall, this is effectively a shearing motion. If the dimension 
is perpendicular to the wall, it is more of a shaking motion. 
A <I>zcylinder</I> or <I>zcone</I> wall can only be wiggled in the z dimension.
</P>
<P>Each timestep, the position of a wiggled wall in the appropriate dim is set according to this equation:
</P>
<PRE>position = coord + A - A cos (omega * delta) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>coord</I> is the specified initial position of the wall, <I>A</I> is the 
amplitude, <I>omega</I> is 2 PI / period, and <I>delta</I> is the time elapsed since 
the fix was specified. The velocity of the wall is set to the derivative of 
this expression.
</P>
<P>For the <I>shear</I> keyword, the wall moves continuously in the specified dimension 
with velocity vshear. The dimension must be tangential to walls with a planar 
wallstyle, e.g. in the y or z directions for an <I>xplane</I> wall. For <I>zcylinder</I> 
walls, a dimension of z means the cylinder is moving in the z-direction along 
it's axis. A dimension of x or y means the cylinder is spinning around the 
z-axis, either in the clockwise direction for vshear > 0 or counter-clockwise 
for vshear < 0. In this case, vshear is the tangential velocity of the wall 
at whatever radius has been defined.
</P>
<P>NOTE: The keywords wiggle or shear can NOT be used for style mesh/gran. 
For a moving granular wall with style style mesh/gran, use the more flexible 
command <A HREF = "fix_move_mesh_gran.html">fix move/mesh/gran</A>.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>temperature</I> is used to assign a constant temperature to the wall.
This setting gets effective in conjunction with heat conduction via 
<A HREF = "fix_heat_gran.html">fix heat/gran</A>. For <I>wallstyle</I> mesh/gran, the value 
for the temperature given in this command is ignored and the temperature 
value is specified per mesh via <A HREF = "fix_mesh_gran.html">fix mesh/gran</A>.
</P>
<P>By specifying <I>store_force</I> = 'yes', you can instruct the command to
store the wall force exerted on the particles in a 
<A HREF = "fix_property.html">fix property/atom</A> with id force_(ID), where (ID) 
is the id of the fix wall/gran command.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>If applicable, contact history is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart files</A> 
so simulations can continue properly. 
None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this fix.
No global scalar or vector or are stored by this fix. 
If <I>store_force</I> = 'yes' is specified, the per-atom wall force can be 
accessed by the various output commands via f_force(ID)<B>1</B>, f_force(ID)<B>2</B>, 
f_force(ID)<B>3</B>. (ID) is the id of the fix wall/gran command.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the start/stop keywords of the 
<A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command. This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A> .
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>There can be only one fix wall/gran command with style <I>mesh/gran</I>. Note that 
this is not really a restriction because you can include multiple fixes 
of type <A HREF = "fix_mesh_gran.html">fix mesh/gran</A> in the fix wall/gran command.
</P>
<P>When using style style <I>mesh/gran</I>, you have to use the style <I>bin</I> for 
the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor command</A>.
</P>
<P>Style <I>mesh/gran</I> can not be used in conjunction with triclinic simulation boxes.
</P>
<P>When using style <I>mesh/gran</I>' in combination with a particle insertion 
command, you always have to keep a minimum distance between the wall and the 
insertion region that is equal to maximum particle radius + half the skin 
defined in the <A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor command</A>. Otherwise, newly inserted 
particles interpenetrate the walls before a triangle neighbor list is built 
the first time.
</P>
<P>The keywords wiggle or shear can NOT be used for style <I>mesh/gran</I>. 
For moving granular wall with style style mesh/gran, use <A HREF = "fix_move_mesh_gran.html">fix move/mesh/gran</A>.
</P>
<P>Any dimension (xyz) that has a planar granular wall must be non-periodic.
