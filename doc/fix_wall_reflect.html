<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Bound the simulation with one or more walls which reflect particles
when they attempt to move thru them. 
</P>
<P>Reflection means that if an atom moves outside the box on a timestep
by a distance delta (e.g. due to <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A>), then it is
put back inside the box by the same delta and the sign of the
corresponding component of its velocity is flipped.
</P>
<P>When used in conjunction with <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> and <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style
verlet</A>, the resultant time-integration algorithm is
equivalent to the primitive splitting algorithm (PSA) described by
<A HREF = "#Bond">Bond</A>.  Because each reflection event divides
the corresponding timestep asymmetrically, energy conservation is only
satisfied to O(dt), rather than to O(dt^2) as it would be for
velocity-Verlet integration without reflective walls.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Any dimension (xyz) that has a reflecting wall must be non-periodic.
</P>
<P>A reflecting wall should not be used with rigid bodies such as those
defined by a "fix rigid" command.  This is because the wall/reflect
displaces atoms directly rather than exerts a force on them.  For
rigid bodies, use a soft wall instead, such as <A HREF = "fix_wall_lj93.html">fix
wall/lj93</A>.  LAMMPS will flag the use of a rigid
fix with fix wall/reflect with a warning, but will not generate an
error.
