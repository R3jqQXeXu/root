fix aveforce command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID aveforce fx fy fz keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
aveforce = style name of this fix command :l
fx,fy,fz = force component values (force units) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {region}  :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region atoms must be in to have added force :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix pressdown topwall aveforce 0.0 -1.0 0.0
fix 2 bottomwall aveforce NULL -1.0 0.0 region top :pre

[Description:]

Apply an additional external force to a group of atoms in such a way
that every atom experiences the same force.  This is useful for
pushing on wall or boundary atoms so that the structure of the wall
does not change over time.

The existing force is averaged for the group of atoms, component by
component.  The actual force on each atom is then set to the average
value plus the component specified in this command.  This means each
atom in the group receives the same force.

If any of the arguments is specified as NULL then the forces in that
dimension are not changed.  Note that this is not the same as
specifying a 0.0 value, since that sets all forces to the same average
value without adding in any additional force.

If the {region} keyword is used, the atom must also be in the
specified geometric "region"_region.html in order to have force added
to it.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a 3-vector of forces, which can be accessed by
various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15.  This is the total
force on the group of atoms before the forces on individual atoms are
changed by the fix.  The vector values calculated by this fix are
"extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of
the "run"_run.html command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the "minimize"_minimize.html command.

[Restrictions:] none

[Default:] none
