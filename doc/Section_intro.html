<A NAME = "1_1"></A><H4>1.1 What is LAMMPS 
</H4>
<P>LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code that models an ensemble
of particles in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state.  It can model
atomic, polymeric, biological, metallic, granular, and coarse-grained
systems using a variety of force fields and boundary conditions.
</P>
<P>For examples of LAMMPS simulations, see the Publications page of the
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW Site</A>.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
machines, but is designed for parallel computers.  It will run on any
parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</A>
message-passing library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory
parallel machines and Beowulf-style clusters.
</P>


<P>LAMMPS can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or
billions.  See <A HREF = "Section_perf.html">this section</A> for information on LAMMPS
performance and scalability, or the Benchmarks section of the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS
WWW Site</A>.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</A>, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See <A HREF = "#1_4">this section</A> for a brief
discussion of the open-source philosophy.
</P>


<P>LAMMPS is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
capabilities, such as new force fields, atom types, boundary
conditions, or diagnostics.  See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> for
more details.
</P>
<P>The current version of LAMMPS is written in C++.  Earlier versions
were written in F77 and F90.  See <A HREF = "Section_history.html">this section</A>
for more information on different versions.  All versions can be
downloaded from the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS WWW Site</A>.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS was originally developed under a US Department of Energy CRADA
(Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) between two DOE labs
and 3 companies.  It is distributed by <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Labs</A>.
See <A HREF = "#1_5">this section</A> for more information on LAMMPS funding and
individuals who have contributed to LAMMPS.
</P>


<P>In the most general sense, LAMMPS integrates Newton's equations of
motion for collections of atoms, molecules, or macroscopic particles
that interact via short- or long-range forces with a variety of
initial and/or boundary conditions.  For computational efficiency
LAMMPS uses neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles.  The
lists are optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive at
short distances, so that the local density of particles never becomes
too large.  On parallel machines, LAMMPS uses spatial-decomposition
techniques to partition the simulation domain into small 3d
sub-domains, one of which is assigned to each processor.  Processors
communicate and store "ghost" atom information for atoms that border
their sub-domain.  LAMMPS is most efficient (in a parallel sense) for
systems whose particles fill a 3d rectangular box with roughly uniform
density.  Papers with technical details of the algorithms used in
LAMMPS are listed in <A HREF = "#1_5">this section</A>.
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME = "1_3"></A><H4>1.3 LAMMPS non-features 
</H4>
<P>LAMMPS is designed to efficiently compute Newton's equations of motion
for a system of interacting particles.  Many of the tools needed to
pre- and post-process the data for such simulations are not included
in the LAMMPS kernel for several reasons:
</P>
<UL><LI>the desire to keep LAMMPS simple
<LI>they are not parallel operations
<LI>other codes already do them
<LI>limited development resources 
</UL>
<P>Specifically, LAMMPS itself does not:
</P>
<UL><LI>run thru a GUI
<LI>build molecular systems
<LI>assign force-field coefficients automagically
<LI>perform sophisticated analyses of your MD simulation
<LI>visualize your MD simulation
<LI>plot your output data 
</UL>
<P>A few tools for pre- and post-processing tasks are provided as part of
the LAMMPS package; they are described in <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this
section</A>.  However, many people use other codes or
write their own tools for these tasks.
</P>
<P>As noted above, our group has also written and released a separate
toolkit called <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which addresses some of the listed
bullets.  It provides tools for doing setup, analysis, plotting, and
visualization for LAMMPS simulations.  Pizza.py is written in
<A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the Pizza.py WWW
site</A>.
</P>
<P>LAMMPS requires as input a list of initial atom coordinates and types,
molecular topology information, and force-field coefficients assigned
to all atoms and bonds.  LAMMPS will not build molecular systems and
assign force-field parameters for you.
</P>
<P>For atomic systems LAMMPS provides a <A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A>
command which places atoms on solid-state lattices (fcc, bcc,
user-defined, etc).  Assigning small numbers of force field
coefficients can be done via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair coeff</A>, <A HREF = "bond_coeff.html">bond
coeff</A>, <A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle coeff</A>, etc commands.
For molecular systems or more complicated simulation geometries, users
typically use another code as a builder and convert its output to
LAMMPS input format, or write their own code to generate atom
coordinate and molecular topology for LAMMPS to read in.
</P>
<P>For complicated molecular systems (e.g. a protein), a multitude of
topology information and hundreds of force-field coefficients must
typically be specified.  We suggest you use a program like
<A HREF = "http://www.scripps.edu/brooks">CHARMM</A> or <A HREF = "http://amber.scripps.edu">AMBER</A> or other molecular builders to setup
such problems and dump its information to a file.  You can then
reformat the file as LAMMPS input.  Some of the tools in <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this
section</A> can assist in this process.
</P>
<P>Similarly, LAMMPS creates output files in a simple format.  Most users
post-process these files with their own analysis tools or re-format
them for input into other programs, including visualization packages.
If you are convinced you need to compute something on-the-fly as
LAMMPS runs, see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> for a discussion
of how you can use the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> and <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> and
<A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands to print out data of your choosing.  Keep in
mind that complicated computations can slow down the molecular
dynamics timestepping, particularly if the computations are not
parallel, so it is often better to leave such analysis to
post-processing codes.
</P>
<P>A very simple (yet fast) visualizer is provided with the LAMMPS
package - see the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html#xmovie">xmovie</A> tool in <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this
section</A>.  It creates xyz projection views of
atomic coordinates and animates them.  We find it very useful for
debugging purposes.  For high-quality visualization we recommend the
following packages:

<LI><A HREF = "http://164.107.79.177/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A>

<LI><A HREF = "http://www.openrasmol.org">RasMol</A> 
</UL>
<P>Other features that LAMMPS does not yet (and may never) support are
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_history.html">this section</A>.
</P>
<P>Finally, these are freely-available molecular dynamics codes, most of
them parallel, which may be well-suited to the problems you want to
model.  They can also be used in conjunction with LAMMPS to perform
complementary modeling tasks.
</P>

<P>CHARMM, AMBER, NAMD, NWCHEM, and Tinker are designed primarily for
modeling biological molecules.  CHARMM and AMBER use
atom-decomposition (replicated-data) strategies for parallelism; NAMD
and NWCHEM use spatial-decomposition approaches, similar to LAMMPS.
Tinker is a serial code.  DL_POLY includes potentials for a variety of
biological and non-biological materials; both a replicated-data and
spatial-decomposition version exist.
