bond_style hybrid command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style hybrid style1 style2 ... :pre

style1,style2 = list of one or more bond styles :ul

[Examples:]

bond_style hybrid harmonic fene
bond_coeff 1 harmonic 80.0 1.2
bond_coeff 2* fene 30.0 1.5 1.0 1.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {hybrid} style enables the use of multiple bond styles in one
simulation.  A bond style is assigned to each bond type.  For example,
bonds in a polymer flow (of bond type 1) could be computed with a
{fene} potential and bonds in the wall boundary (of bond type 2) could
be computed with a {harmonic} potential.  The assignment of bond type
to style is made via the "bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command or in
the data file.

In the bond_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the bond style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
In the example above, the 2 bond_coeff commands would set bonds of
bond type 1 to be computed with a {harmonic} potential with
coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, r0.  All other bond types (2-N) would be
computed with a {fene} potential with coefficients 30.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0
for K, R0, epsilon, sigma.

A bond style of {none} can be specified as the 2nd argument to the
bond_coeff command, if you desire to turn off certain bond types.

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 section for more info on packages.

Unlike other bond styles, the hybrid bond style does not store bond
coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a restart
file, you need to re-specify bond_coeff commands.
