ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
enforce2d = style name of this fix command :ul

[Examples:]

fix 5 all enforce2d :pre

[Description:]

Zero out the z-dimension velocity and force on each atom in the group.
This is useful when running a 2d simulation to insure that atoms do
not move from their initial z coordinate.
