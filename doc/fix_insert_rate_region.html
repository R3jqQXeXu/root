</PRE>
<P><B>General description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles into a granular run every few timesteps 
within a specified region at a specified rate.
</P>
<P>This command must use the <I>region</I> keyword to define an insertion
volume. The specified region must have been previously defined with a
<A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command. Each timestep particles are inserted, 
they are placed randomly inside the insertion volume. 
</P>
<P>To specify the number of particles to be inserted, you must use either
the <I>nparticles</I> or the <I>mass</I> keyword (but not both). In the latter
case, the number of particles to be inserted is calculated from the
mass expectancy given by the particle distribution. 
</P>
<P>Likewise, you can use the <I>particlerate</I> or the <I>massrate</I> keyword (but not both) 
to control the insertion rate. 
</P>
<P>The frequency of the particle insertion is controlled by the 
keyword <I>insert_every</I>, which defines the number of time-steps 
between two insertions. The number of particles to be inserted
at each insertion event is calculated from the insertion rate 
and <I>insert_every</I>. The <I>start</I> keyword can be used to set 
the time-step at which the insertion should start.
</P>
<P>This command must use the distributiontemplate keyword to refer to a 
<A HREF = "fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">fix_particledistribution_discrete</A> (defined by dist-fix-ID) that defines the properties of the 
inserted particles.
</P>
<P>Inserted particles are assigned the atom type specified by the 
particledistribution defined via the <A HREF = "fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">fix_particledistribution_discrete</A> and
are assigned to 4 groups: the default group "all" and the group
specified in the fix insert command, as well as the groups specified 
in the <A HREF = "fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">fix_particledistribution_discrete</A> and <A HREF = "fix_particletemplate_sphere.html">fix_particletemplate_sphere</A>
command (all of which can also be "all").
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>overlapcheck</I> controls if overlap is checked for at insertion,
both within the inserted particle package and with other existig particles. 
If this option is turned off, insertion will scale very well in parallel, 
otherwise not. Be aware that in case of no overlap check, highly overlapping
configurations will be produced, so you will have to relax these configurations.
</P>
<P>If overlapcheck if performed, the number of insertion attempts per 
particle can be specified via the <I>maxattempt</I> keyword. Each timestep 
particles are inserted, the command will make up to a total of M tries 
to insert the new particles without overlaps, where 
M = # of inserted particles * ma.  If unsuccessful at completing all 
insertions, a warning will be printed.
</P>
<P>The <I>all_in</I> flag determines if the particle is completely contained 
in the insertion region (<I>all_in yes</I>) or only the particle center 
(<I>all_in no</I>). Currently <I>all_in yes</I> is not yet supported for all
types of insertion.
</P>
<P>The initial velocity and rotational velocity can be controlled via the
<I>vel</I> and <I>omega</I> keywords.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  This means you can restart a simulation simulation
while inserting particles, when the restart file was written during the
insertion operation. 
</P>
<P>None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this
fix.  No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by
this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can be
used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>overlapcheck</I> = 'yes' option performs an inherently serial operation
and will thus not scale well in parallel. For this reason, if you
want to generate large systems, you are advised to turn <I>overlapcheck</I> 
off and let the packing relax afterwards to generate a valid packing.
</P>
<P>Keywords <I>duration</I> and <I>extrude_length</I> can not be used together.
</P>
<P>Currently <I>all_in yes</I> is not yet supported for all types of insertion.
