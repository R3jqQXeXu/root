are available for dumping granular mesh geometry into STL files or
VTK files. The former command is used for dumping only the geometry,
while the latter command is used to dump the stress calculated on a
granular mesh using the <A HREF="fix_mesh_gran_stressanalysis.html">fix
mesh/gran/stressanalysis</A> command. </SPAN>
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B> 
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps in one of several styles. As described below, the filename
determines the kind of output (text or binary or gzipped, one big
file or one per timestep, one big file or one per processor). Only
information for atoms in the specified group is dumped. The
<A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command can also alter
what atoms are included. Not all styles support all these options;
see details below. 
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced
only on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of
an atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box. 
</P>
<P>When LAMMPS is running in parallel, the atom information written
to dump files (typically one line per atom) may be written in an
indeterminate order. This is because data for a single snapshot is
collected from multiple processors. This is always the case for the
<I>atom</I>, <I>local</I>, and <I>custom</I> styles. It is also the
case for the <I>xyz</I> style if the dump group is not <I>all</I>. It
is not the case for the <I>dcd</I> and <I>xtc</I> styles which always
write atoms in sorted order. So does the <I>xyz</I> style if the dump
group is <I>all</I>. The <I>cfg</I> style supports the <I>sort</I>
option of the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command
which allows sorting to be turned on or off. 
</P>
<HR>
<P>The <I>style</I> keyword determines what atom quantities are
written to the file and in what format. Settings made via the
<A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command can also alter the
format of individual values and the file itself. 
</P>
<P>The <I>atom</I>, <I>local</I>, and <I>custom</I> styles create
files in a simple text format that is self-explanatory when viewing a
dump file. Many of the LAMMPS <A HREF="Section_tools.html">post-processing
tools</A>, including <A HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A>,
work with this format. 
</P>
<P>For post-processing purposes the <I>atom</I> and <I>custom</I>
text files are self-describing in the following sense. The simulation
box bounds are included in each snapshot and if the box is triclinic
(non-orthogonal), then the tilt factors are also printed; see the
<A HREF="region.html">region prism</A> command for a description of
tilt factors. For triclinic boxes the box bounds themselves (first 2
quantities on each line) are a true &quot;bounding box&quot; around
the simulation domain, which means they include the effect of any
tilt. The &quot;ITEM: ATOMS&quot; line in each snapshot also lists
the meaning of each column of the per-atom lines that follow. For
example, this would be &quot;id type xs ys zs&quot; for the default
<I>atom</I> style, and it will be the atom attributes you specify in
the dump command for the <I>custom</I> style. 
</P>
<P>For style <I>atom</I>, atom coordinates are written to the file,
along with the atom ID and atom type. By default, atom coords are
written in a scaled format (from 0 to 1). I.e. an x value of 0.25
means the atom is at a location 1/4 of the distance from xlo to xhi
of the box boundaries. The format can be changed to unscaled coords
via the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> settings. Image
flags can also be added for each atom via dump_modify. 
</P>
<P>Style <I>custom</I> allows you to specify a list of atom
attributes to be written to the dump file for each atom. Possible
attributes are listed above and will appear in the order specified.
You cannot specify a quantity that is not defined for a particular
simulation - such as <I>q</I> for atom style <I>bond</I>, since that
atom style doesn't assign charges. Dumps occur at the very end of a
timestep, so atom attributes will include effects due to fixes that
are applied during the timestep. An explanation of the possible dump
custom attributes is given below. 
</P>
<P>For style <I>local</I>, local output generated by <A HREF="compute.html">computes</A>
and <A HREF="fix.html">fixes</A> is used to gnerate lines of output
that is written to the dump file. This local data is typically
calculated by each processor based on the atoms it owns, but there
may be zero or more entities per atom, e.g. a list of bond distances.
An explanation of the possible dump local attributes is given below.
Note that by using input from the <A HREF="compute_property_local.html">compute
property/local</A> command with dump local, it is possible to
generate information on bonds, angles, etc that can be cut and pasted
directly into a data file read by the <A HREF="read_data.html">read_data</A>
command. 
</P>
<P>Style <I>cfg</I> has the same command syntax as style <I>custom</I>
and writes extended CFG format files, as used by the <A HREF="http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A">AtomEye</A>
visualization package. Since the extended CFG format uses a single
snapshot of the system per file, a wild-card &quot;*&quot; must be
included in the filename, as discussed below. The list of atom
attributes for style <I>cfg</I> must begin with &quot;id type xs ys
zs&quot;, since these quantities are needed to write the CFG files in
the appropriate format (though the &quot;id&quot; and &quot;type&quot;
fields do not appear explicitly in the file). Any remaining
attributes will be stored as &quot;auxiliary properties&quot; in the
CFG files. Note that you will typically want to use the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify
element</A> command with CFG-formatted files, to associate element
names with atom types, so that AtomEye can render atoms
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>The <I>dcd</I> style writes DCD files, a standard atomic
trajectory format used by the CHARMM, NAMD, and XPlor molecular
dynamics packages. DCD files are binary and thus may not be portable
to different machines. The dump group must be <I>all</I> for the <I>dcd</I>
style. The <I>unwrap</I> option of the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>
command allows DCD coordinates to be written &quot;unwrapped&quot; by
the image flags for each atom. Unwrapped means that if the atom has
passed thru a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is
printed for what the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped
back into the periodic box. Note that these coordinates may thus be
far outside the box size stored with the snapshot. 
</P>
<P>The <I>xtc</I> style writes XTC files, a compressed trajectory
format used by the GROMACS molecular dynamics package, and described
<A HREF="http://www.gromacs.org/documentation/reference_3.3/online/xtc.html">here</A>.
The precision used in XTC files can be adjusted via the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>
command. The default value of 1000 means that coordinates are stored
to 1/1000 nanometer accuracy. XTC files are portable binary files
written in the NFS XDR data format, so that any machine which
supports XDR should be able to read them. The dump group must be <I>all</I>
for the <I>xtc</I> style. The <I>unwrap</I> option of the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>
command allows XTC coordinates to be written &quot;unwrapped&quot; by
the image flags for each atom. Unwrapped means that if the atom has
passed thru a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is
printed for what the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped
back into the periodic box. Note that these coordinates may thus be
far outside the box size stored with the snapshot. 
</P>
<P>The <I>xyz</I> style writes XYZ files, which is a simple
text-based coordinate format that many codes can read. 
</P>
<P>The <I>stl</I> style dumps active STL geometries defined via <A HREF="../fix_mesh_gran.html">fix
mesh/gran</A> commands into the specified file. If you do not supply
the optional list of mesh IDs, all meshes are dumped, irrespective of
weather they are used in a <A HREF="../fix_wall_gran.html">fix_wall_gran</A>
or not. By specifying list of mesh IDs you can explicitly choose
which meshes to dump. The group-ID is ignored, because the command is
not applied to particles, but to all active STL geometries . Use a
filename like 'mydumpfile.stl' if the mesh is stationary. <BR>This
dump is especially useful if one or more fixes of type <A HREF="../fix_move_mesh_gran.html">move/mesh/gran</A>
are registered. If the position of the mesh is changed over time and
you want to dump one file for each dump timestep for post-processing
together with the particle data , you should use a filename like
'mydumpfile*.stl'. As outlined in the manual for the <A HREF="../done">dump</A>
command, the '*' is then replaced by the timestep .<BR>Note: This
series of files can then be post-processed together with the particle
dump file converted to VTK in Paraview , <A HREF="http://www.paraview.org/">www.paraview.org</A></P>
<P>The <I>mesh</I> style can be used to dumps active mesh geometries
defined via <A HREF="../fix_mesh_gran_stressanalysis.html">fix
mesh/gran/stressanalysis</A> commands along with stress calculated on
the mesh into the specified file using a VTK file format. The
dump-identifier 'stress' is mandatory, the list of mesh IDs is
optional. As with the <I>stl</I> style, all active meshes are dumped
if you do not supply the optional list of mesh IDs. By specifying
list of mesh IDs you can explicitly choose which meshes to dump. The
group-ID is ignored, because the command is not applied to particles.
Use a filename like 'mydumpfile.vtk' if the mesh is stationary. <BR>This
dump is especially useful if one or more fixes of type <A HREF="../fix_move_mesh_gran.html">move/mesh/gran</A>
are registered. If the position of the mesh is changed over time and
you want to dump one file for each dump timestep for post-processing
together with the particle data , you should use a filename like
'mydumpfile*.vtk'. As outlined in the manual for the <A HREF="../done">dump</A>
command, the '*' is then replaced by the timestep .<BR>Note: This
series of files can then be post-processed together with the particle
dump file converted to VTK in Paraview , <A HREF="http://www.paraview.org/">www.paraview.org</A>
</P>
<P>Note that DCD, XTC, and XYZ formatted files can be read directly
by <A HREF="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd">VMD</A> (a popular
molecular viewing program). We are told VMD will also read LAMMPS
<I>atom</I> style dump files since someone has added a LAMMPS format
plug-in to VMD. It may require an initial snapshot from an XYZ
formatted file to get started. 
</P>
<HR>
<P>Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N
(including timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if
the minimization converges. Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N. This behavior can be
changed via the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A>
command, which can be useful if the dump command is invoked after a
minimization ended on an arbitrary timestep. N can be changed between
runs by using the <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A>
command (not allowed for <I>dcd</I> style). 
</P>
<P>The specified filename determines how the dump file(s) is written.
The default is to write one large text file, which is opened when the
dump command is invoked and closed when an <A HREF="undump.html">undump</A>
command is used or when LAMMPS exits. For the <I>dcd</I> and <I>xtc</I>
styles, this is a single large binary file. 
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wild-card characters. If a &quot;*&quot;
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the &quot;*&quot; character is replaced with the timestep
value. For example, tmp.dump.* becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.10000,
tmp.dump.20000, etc. This option is not available for the <I>dcd</I>
and <I>xtc</I> styles. 
</P>
<P>If a &quot;%&quot; character appears in the filename, then one
file is written for each processor and the &quot;%&quot; character is
replaced with the processor ID from 0 to P-1. For example, tmp.dump.%
becomes tmp.dump.0, tmp.dump.1, ... tmp.dump.P-1, etc. This creates
smaller files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines
that support parallel I/O for output. This option is not available
for the <I>dcd</I>, <I>xtc</I>, and <I>xyz</I> styles. 
</P>
<P>Note that the &quot;*&quot; and &quot;%&quot; characters can be
used together to produce a large number of small dump files! 
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with &quot;.bin&quot;, the dump file (or
files, if &quot;*&quot; or &quot;%&quot; is also used) is written in
binary format. A binary dump file will be about the same size as a
text version, but will typically write out much faster. Of course,
when post-processing, you will need to convert it back to text format
(see the <A HREF="Section_tools.html#binary">binary2txt tool</A>) or
write your own code to read the binary file. The format of the binary
file can be understood by looking at the tools/binary2txt.cpp file.
This option is only available for the <I>atom</I> and <I>custom</I>
styles. 
</P>
<P>If the filename ends with &quot;.gz&quot;, the dump file (or
files, if &quot;*&quot; or &quot;%&quot; is also used) is written in
gzipped format. A gzipped dump file will be about 3x smaller than the
text version, but will also take longer to write. This option is not
available for the <I>dcd</I> and <I>xtc</I> styles. 
</P>
<HR>
<P>This section explains the local attributes that can be specified
as part of the <I>local</I> style. 
</P>
<P>The <I>index</I> attribute can be used to generate an index number
from 1 to N for each line written into the dump file, where N is the
total number of local datums from all processors, or lines of output
that will appear in the snapshot. Note that because data from
different processors depend on what atoms they currently own, and
atoms migrate between processor, there is no guarantee that the same
index will be used for the same info (e.g. a particular bond) in
successive snapshots. 
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow local vectors
or arrays calculated by a <A HREF="compute.html">compute</A> to be
output. The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID
of the compute that has been defined previously in the input script.
See the <A HREF="compute.html">compute</A> command for details. There
are computes for calculating local information such as indices,
types, and energies for bonds and angles. 
</P>
<P>Note that computes which calculate global or per-atom quantities,
as opposed to local quantities, cannot be output in a dump local
command. Instead, global quantities can be output by the <A HREF="thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> command, and per-atom quantities can be output by the dump
custom command. 
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the local vector
calculated by the compute is printed. If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then
N must be in the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of
the M-length local array calculated by the compute. 
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow local vectors
or arrays calculated by a <A HREF="fix.html">fix</A> to be output.
The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the actual ID of the
fix that has been defined previously in the input script. 
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the local vector
calculated by the fix is printed. If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N
must be in the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the
M-length local array calculated by the fix. 
</P>
<HR>
<P>This section explains the atom attributes that can be specified as
part of the <I>custom</I> and <I>cfg</I> styles. 
</P>
<P>The <I>id</I>, <I>mol</I>, <I>type</I>, <I>mass</I>, <I>vx</I>,
<I>vy</I>, <I>vz</I>, <I>fx</I>, <I>fy</I>, <I>fz</I>, <I>q</I>
attributes are self-explanatory. 
</P>
<P><I>Id</I> is the atom ID. <I>Mol</I> is the molecule ID, included
in the data file for molecular systems. <I>Type</I> is the atom type.
<I>Mass</I> is the atom mass. <I>Vx</I>, <I>vy</I>, <I>vz</I>, <I>fx</I>,
<I>fy</I>, <I>fz</I>, and <I>q</I> are components of atom velocity
and force and atomic charge. 
</P>
<P>There are several options for outputting atom coordinates. The <I>x</I>,
<I>y</I>, <I>z</I> attributes write atom coordinates &quot;unscaled&quot;,
in the appropriate distance <A HREF="units.html">units</A>
(Angstroms, sigma, etc). Use <I>xs</I>, <I>ys</I>, <I>zs</I> if you
want the coordinates &quot;scaled&quot; to the box size, so that each
value is 0.0 to 1.0. If the simluation box is triclinic (tilted),
then all atom coords will still be between 0.0 and 1.0. Use <I>xu</I>,
<I>yu</I>, <I>zu</I> if you want the coordinates &quot;unwrapped&quot;
by the image flags for each atom. Unwrapped means that if the atom
has passed thru a periodic boundary one or more times, the value is
printed for what the coordinate would be if it had not been wrapped
back into the periodic box. Note that using <I>xu</I>, <I>yu</I>, <I>zu</I>
means that the coordinate values may be far outside the box bounds
printed with the snapshot. The image flags can be printed directly
using the <I>ix</I>, <I>iy</I>, <I>iz</I> attributes. The <A HREF="dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>
command describes in more detail what is meant by scaled vs unscaled
coordinates and the image flags. 
</P>
<P>The <I>mux</I>, <I>muy</I>, <I>muz</I> attributes are specific to
dipolar systems defined with an atom style of <I>dipole</I>. They
give the orientation of the atom's point dipole moment. 
</P>
<P>The <I>radius</I> attribute is specific to extended spherical
particles that have a finite size, such as granular particles defined
with an atom style of <I>granular</I>. 
</P>
<P>The <I>omegax</I>, <I>omegay</I>, and <I>omegaz</I> attributes are
specific to extended spherical or aspherical particles that have an
angular velocity. Only certain atom styles, such as <I>granular</I>
or <I>dipole</I> define this quantity. 
</P>
<P>The <I>angmomx</I>, <I>angmomy</I>, and <I>angmomz</I> attributes
are specific to extended aspherical particles that have an angular
momentum. Only the <I>ellipsoid</I> atom style defines this quantity.
</P>
<P>The <I>quatw</I>, <I>quati</I>, <I>quatj</I>, <I>quatk</I>
attributes are for aspherical particles defined with an atom style of
<I>ellipsoid</I>. They are the components of the quaternion that
defines the orientation of the particle. 
</P>
<P>The <I>tqx</I>, <I>tqy</I>, <I>tqz</I> attributes are for extended
spherical or aspherical particles that can sustain a rotational
torque due to interactions with other particles. 
</P>
<P>The <I>c_ID</I> and <I>c_ID[N]</I> attributes allow per-atom
vectors or arrays calculated by a <A HREF="compute.html">compute</A>
to be output. The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the
actual ID of the compute that has been defined previously in the
input script. See the <A HREF="compute.html">compute</A> command for
details. There are computes for calculating the per-atom energy,
stress, centro-symmetry parameter, and coordination number of
individual atoms. 
</P>
<P>Note that computes which calculate global or local quantities, as
opposed to per-atom quantities, cannot be output in a dump custom
command. Instead, global quantities can be output by the <A HREF="thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> command, and local quantities can be output by the dump
local command. 
</P>
<P>If <I>c_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector
calculated by the compute is printed. If <I>c_ID[N]</I> is used, then
N must be in the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of
the M-length per-atom array calculated by the compute. 
</P>
<P>The <I>f_ID</I> and <I>f_ID[N]</I> attributes allow vector or
array per-atom quantities calculated by a <A HREF="fix.html">fix</A>
to be output. The ID in the attribute should be replaced by the
actual ID of the fix that has been defined previously in the input
script. The <A HREF="fix_ave_atom.html">fix ave/atom</A> command is
one that calculates per-atom quantities. Since it can time-average
per-atom quantities produced by any <A HREF="compute.html">compute</A>,
<A HREF="fix.html">fix</A>, or atom-style <A HREF="variable.html">variable</A>,
this allows those time-averaged results to be written to a dump file.
</P>
<P>If <I>f_ID</I> is used as a attribute, then the per-atom vector
calculated by the fix is printed. If <I>f_ID[N]</I> is used, then N
must be in the range from 1-M, which will print the Nth column of the
M-length per-atom array calculated by the fix. 
</P>
<P>The <I>v_name</I> attribute allows per-atom vectors calculated by
a <A HREF="variable.html">variable</A> to be output. The name in the
attribute should be replaced by the actual name of the variable that
has been defined previously in the input script. Only an atom-style
variable can be referenced, since it is the only style that generates
per-atom values. Variables of style <I>atom</I> can reference
individual atom attributes, per-atom atom attributes, thermodynamic
keywords, or invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are
evaluated, so this is a very general means of creating quantities to
output to a dump file. 
</P>
<P>See <A HREF="Section_modify.html">this section</A> of the manual
for information on how to add new compute and fix styles to LAMMPS to
calculate per-atom quantities which could then be output into dump
files.

<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>To write gzipped dump files, you must compile LAMMPS with the
-DLAMMPS_GZIP option - see the <A HREF="Section_start.html#2_2">Making
LAMMPS</A> section of the documentation. 
</P>
<P>The <I>xtc</I> style is part of the &quot;xtc&quot; package. It is
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF="Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info. This is because some machines may
not support the lo-level XDR data format that XTC files are written
with, which will result in a compile-time error when a lo-level
include file is not found. Putting this style in a package makes it
easy to exclude from a LAMMPS build for those machines. However, the
XTC package also includes two compatibility header files and
associated functions, which should be a suitable substitute on
machines that do not have the appropriate native header files. This
option can be invoked at build time by adding -DLAMMPS_XDR to the
CCFLAGS variable in the appropriate lo-level Makefile, e.g.
src/MAKE/Makefile.foo. This compatibility mode has been tested
successfully on Cray XT3 and IBM BlueGene/L machines and should also
work on the Cray XT4, IBM BG/P, and Windows XP machines.
