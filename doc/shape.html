<H3>shape command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>shape I x y z 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>I = atom type (see asterisk form below)
<LI>x = x diameter (distance units)
<LI>y = y diameter (distance units)
<LI>z = z diameter (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>shape 1 1.0 1.0 1.0
shape * 3.0 1.0 1.0
shape 2* 3.0 1.0 1.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set the shape for all atoms of one or more atom types.  In LAMMPS,
particles that have a finite size are said to have a "shape", as
opposed to being a point mass.  The shape can be spherical or
aspherical, depending on whether the 3 shape values are the same or
different.  Shape values can also be set in the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> data file using the "Shapes" keyword.  See
the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command for what distance units to use.
</P>
<P>The I index can be specified in one of two ways.  An explicit numeric
value can be used, as in the 1st example above.  Or a wild-card
asterisk can be used to set the shape for multiple atom types.  This
takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N = the number of
atom types, then an asterisk with no numeric values means all types
from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from 1 to n
(inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).
</P>
<P>A line in a <A HREF = "read_data.html">data file</A> that follows the "Shapes"
keyword specifies shape using the same format as the arguments of the
shape command in an input script, except that no wild-card asterisk
can be used.  For example, under the "Shapes" section of a data file,
the line that corresponds to the 1st example above would be listed as
</P>
<PRE>1 1.0 1.0 1.0 
</PRE>
<P>The shape values can be set to all 0.0, which means that atoms of that
type are point particles and not finite-size particles.  Some pair
styles and fixes and computes that operate on finite-size particles
allow for a mixture of finite-size and point particles.  See the doc
pages of individual commands for details.
</P>
<P>Note that the shape command can only be used if the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom
style</A> requires per-type atom shape to be set.
Currently, only the <I>colloid</I>, <I>dipole</I>, and <I>ellipsoid</I> styles do.
The <I>granular</I> and <I>peri</I> styles also define finite-size spherical
particles, but their size is set on a per-particle basis.  These are
are defined in the data file read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
command, or set to default values by the
<A HREF = "create_atoms.html">create_atoms</A> command, or set to new values by the
<A HREF = "set.html">set diameter</A> command.
</P>
<P>Dipoles use the atom shape to compute a moment of inertia for
rotational energy.  See the <A HREF = "pair_dipole.html">pair_style dipole</A>
command.  Only the 1st component of the shape is used since the
particles are assumed to be spherical.
</P>
<P>Ellipsoids use the atom shape to compute a generalized inertia tensor.
For example, a shape setting of 3.0 1.0 1.0 defines a particle 3x
longer in x than in y or z and with a circular cross-section in yz.
Ellipsoids which are in fact spherical can be defined by setting all 3
shape components the same.
</P>
<P>If you define a <A HREF = "atom_style.html">hybrid atom style</A> which includes one
(or more) sub-styles which require per-type shape and one (or more)
sub-styles which require per-atom diameter, then you must define both.
However, in this case the per-type shape will be ignored; only the
per-atom diameter will be used by LAMMPS.  This means you cannot
currently mix aspherical particles with per-atom diameter particles.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command must come after the simulation box is defined by a
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>, <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>, or
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command.
</P>
<P>All shapes must be defined before a simulation is run (if the atom
style requires shapes be set).
