<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Impose an additional acceleration on each particle in the group.  This
fix is typically used with granular systems to include a "gravity"
term acting on the macroscopic particles.  More generally, it can
represent any kind of driving field, e.g. a pressure gradient inducing
a Poiseuille flow in a fluid.  Note that this fix operates differently
than the <A HREF = "fix_addforce.html">fix addforce</A> command.  The addforce fix
adds the same force to each atom, independent of its mass.  This
command imparts the same acceleration to each atom (force/mass).
</P>
<P>The <I>magnitude</I> of the acceleration is specified in force/mass units.
For granular systems (LJ units) this is typically 1.0.  See the
<A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>Style <I>chute</I> is typically used for simulations of chute flow where
the specified angle is the chute angle, with flow occurring in the +x
direction.  For 3d systems, the tilt is away from the z axis; for 2d
systems, the tilt is away from the y axis.
</P>
<P>Style <I>spherical</I> allows an arbitrary 3d direction to be specified for
the acceleration vector.  Phi and theta are defined in the usual
spherical coordinates.  Thus for acceleration acting in the -z
direction, theta would be 180.0 (or -180.0).  Theta = 90.0 and phi =
-90.0 would mean acceleration acts in the -y direction.  For 2d
systems, <I>phi</I> is ignored and <I>theta</I> is an angle in the xy plane
where theta = 0.0 is the y-axis.
</P>
<P>Style <I>gradient</I> is the same as style <I>spherical</I> except that the
direction of the acceleration vector is time dependent.  The units of
the gradient arguments are in full rotations per time unit.  E.g. a
timestep of 0.001 and a gradient of 0.1 means the acceleration vector
would rotate thru 360 degrees every 10,000 timesteps.  For the
time-dependent case, the initial direction of the acceleration vector
is set to phi,theta when the fix is specified and evolves thereafter.
For 2d systems, <I>phi</I> and <I>phi_grad</I> are ignored.
</P>
<P>Style <I>vector</I> imposes an acceleration in the vector direction given
by (x,y,z).  For 2d systems, the z component is ignored.
