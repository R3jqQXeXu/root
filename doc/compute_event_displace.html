<H3>compute event/displace command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute ID group-ID event/displace threshold 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "compute.html">compute</A> command
<LI>event/displace = style name of this compute command
<LI>threshold = minimum distance anyparticle must move to trigger an event (distance units) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 all event/displace 0.5 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that flags an "event" if any particle in the
group has moved a distance greater than the specified threshold
distance when compared to a previously stored reference state
(i.e. the previous event).  This compute is typically used in
conjunction with the <A HREF = "prd.html">prd</A> command, to detect if a transition
to a new minimum energy basin has occurred.
</P>
<P>This value calculated by the compute is equal to 0 if no particle has
moved far enough, and equal to 1 if one or more particles have moved
further than the threshold distance.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global scalar (the flag).  This value can be
used by any command that uses a global scalar value from a compute as
input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">this section</A> for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".  The
scalar value will be a 0 or 1 as explained above.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the "prd"
package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section for
more info on packages.
