<H3>bond_style hybrid command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>bond_style hybrid style1 style2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style1,style2 = list of one or more bond styles 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>bond_style hybrid harmonic fene
bond_coeff 1 harmonic 80.0 1.2
bond_coeff 2* fene 30.0 1.5 1.0 1.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple bond styles in one
simulation.  A bond style is assigned to each bond type.  For example,
bonds in a polymer flow (of bond type 1) could be computed with a
<I>fene</I> potential and bonds in the wall boundary (of bond type 2) could
be computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential.  The assignment of bond type
to style is made via the <A HREF = "bond_coeff.html">bond_coeff</A> command or in
the data file.
</P>
<P>In the bond_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the bond style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
In the example above, the 2 bond_coeff commands would set bonds of
bond type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential with
coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, r0.  All other bond types (2-N) would be
computed with a <I>fene</I> potential with coefficients 30.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0
for K, R0, epsilon, sigma.
</P>
<P>A bond style of <I>none</I> can be specified as the 2nd argument to the
bond_coeff command, if you desire to turn off certain bond types.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"molecular" package (which it is by default).  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>Unlike other bond styles, the hybrid bond style does not store bond
coefficient info for individual sub-styles in a <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  Thus when retarting a simulation from a restart
file, you need to re-specify bond_coeff commands.
