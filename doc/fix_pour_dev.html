<P><B>LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info: </B>
</P>
<P>This LIGGGHTS command offers the following improvements vs.
LAMMPS:<BR>Fix pour/legacy has been introduced in version 1.0.3. It
is quite similar to fix <A HREF="fix_pour.html">pour</A>, but some
major re-works allow the following new capabilities: With fix
pour/dev, you can now define conditions for mass-flow rate and total
insertion mass. The insertion height probability has been re-worked
to be in accordance with the velocity distribution . Moreover, fix
pour/dev has now restart capability, which means that it is not
necessary to change the fix parameters in a restarted simulation run.
The insertion takes place in a way that allows higher volume
fractions than the old fix pour command for poly-disperse
simulations. The fix pour/dev command can now takes discrete particle
distributions, defined by a new fix <A HREF="fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">particledistribution/discrete</A>
command. The particles that are generated in a way that they are now
completely located within the insertion region, e.g. it is now e.g.
possible to use the whole simulation box as insertion region.
Furthermore, you can now choose from different random styles for the
properties of the particles to be inserted. For poly-disperse
pouring, you can now achieve the desired volume fraction more easily.
</P>
<P>The LAMMPS-style version of this command is available under <A HREF="fix_pour_legacy.html">fix
pour/legacy</A>.</P>
<P><B>Description:</B> 
</P>
<P>Insert particles into a granular run every few timesteps within a
specified region. This is useful for simulating the pouring of
particles into a container under the influence of gravity. 
</P>
<P>This command specify by means of <I>targetspecifier</I> if the
goal is to insert a certain number of particles or a certain mass of
particles, where the mass (number of particles) is set by <I>target.</I></P>
<P>This command must use the <I>distributiontemplate</I> keyword to
refer to a fix of type <A HREF="fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">particledistribution/discrete</A>
(defined by dist-fix-ID) that defines the properties of the particles
to be inserted r the insertion. 
</P>
<P>Inserted particles are assigned the properties as defined by the
fix <A HREF="fix_particledistribution_discrete.html">particledistribution/discrete</A>
and are assigned to two groups: the default group &quot;all&quot; and
the group specified in the fix pour command (which can also be
&quot;all&quot;). 
</P>
<P>This command must use the <I>region</I> keyword to define an
insertion volume. The specified region must have been previously
defined with a <A HREF="region.html">region</A> command. It must be
of type <I>block</I> or a z-axis <I>cylinder</I> and must be defined
with side = <I>in</I>. The cylinder style of region can only be used
with 3d simulations. With the optional <I>regionexempts</I> keyword,
you can specify regions to exempt from the insertion region. These
regions can be of any style (see <A HREF="region.html">region</A>
command). Please note that the target volume fraction is still
calculated using the whole insertion volume as specified by the
<I>region</I> keyword.</P>
<P>Each timestep particles are inserted, they are placed randomly
inside the insertion volume so as to mimic a stream of poured
particles. The larger the volume, the more particles that can be
inserted at any one timestep. Particles are inserted again after
enough time has elapsed that the previously inserted particles fall
out of the insertion volume under the influence of gravity.
Insertions continue every so many timesteps until the desired # of
particles has been inserted. Particles are inserted at a height that
is in accordance with the velocity distribution.</P>
<P>All other keywords are optional with defaults as shown below. The
<I>vel</I> option enables inserted particles to have a range of xy
velocities. The specific values for a particular inserted particle
will be chosen randomly where you can choose between <I>uniform</I>
and <I>gaussian</I> random styles for <I>vx, vy (for 3d).</I> The <I>vz</I>
or <I>vy</I> value for option <I>vel</I> assigns a z-velocity (3d) or
y-velocity (2d) to each inserted particle. 
</P>
<P>The <I>vol</I> option specifies what volume fraction of the
insertion volume will be filled with particles. The higher the value,
the more particles are inserted each timestep. Since inserted
particles cannot overlap, the maximum volume fraction should be no
higher than about 0.6 (for mono-disperese simulation). Each timestep
particles are inserted, LAMMPS will make up to a total of M tries to
insert the new particles without overlaps, where M = # of inserted
particles * Nattempt. If LAMMPS is unsuccessful at completing all
insertions, it prints a warning. 
</P>
<P>The <I>rate</I> option moves the insertion volume in the z
direction (3d) or y direction (2d). This enables pouring particles
from a successively higher height over time. 
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Insertion will stop if either the specified
mass-flow rate or the specified volume fraction is reached. In case
you want to make sure as many particles as possible are inserted, you
should specify a large value for vol, e.g. 0.6. If the mass-flow rate
can still be not achieved, you have to choose a higher insertion
velocity. This command also offers the option to exempt certain
regions from the specified insertion region</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Be careful not to choose the insertion volume too
small. Compared to the LAMMPS style fix pour command, the volume has
to be larger because the particles are completely located within the
insertion volume.</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Information about this fix is written to <A HREF="restart.html">binary
restart files </A>. This means you can restart a pouring simulation,
when the restart file was written in the middle of the pouring
operation. 
</P>
<P>None of the <A HREF="fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are
relevant to this fix. No global scalar or vector or per-atom
quantities are stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF="Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>. No parameter of this fix can be used with the
<I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF="run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF="minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>. 
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> 
</P>
<P>For 3d simulations, a gravity fix in the -z direction must be
defined for use in conjunction with this fix. For 2d simulations,
gravity must be defined in the -y direction. 
</P>
<P>The specified insertion region cannot be a &quot;dynamic&quot;
region, as defined by the <A HREF="region.html">region</A> command.
